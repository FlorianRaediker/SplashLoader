SplashLoader loads splash texts from any domain. That is, all assets/*/texts/splashes.txt files are merged so that mods can add their own splashes.
In addition, splash texts can be added to a splashes.json file which allows you to specify further properties of the splash texts such as
 • Translate certain splash texts
 • Show splash texts only on a certain day, next to the "normal" splash texts
 • Show only certain splash texts on a specific day (like Minecraft's "Merry X-mas!", "Happy new year!" and "OOoooOOOoo! Spooky!")
 • Delete splash texts from other domains
For more information, see the Mod's GitHub repository.
